# super-markdown

This will be the home for the dev.to markdown renderer. It's going to be a superset of markdown. We want to build on top of the markdown spec to include custom embeds, custom elements like charts and graphs, interactive elements, etc. Right now this is just an exploratory idea, but feedback is super-duper welcome.

#### Open issues to provide any feedback or ideas

We want to extend markdown, but we want to be cautious and do it in the right way. This will be for [dev.to](https://dev.to), but obviously available for whoever wants to get onboard with this. I'm not expert in the markdown spec, its history, so I'm just taking my time learning. Anyone more experienced than me (Ben) is strongly encouraged to provide input.
